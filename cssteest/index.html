			<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few years ago, a friend of mine dragged me into a dance lesson which included some ballroom styles as well as East Coast Swing.
	&nbsp; I had so much fun dancing that we decided to take some beginners swing lessons.&nbsp; I have always loved singing, 
	playing, and listening to swing music, so making me dance to it didn't take much convincing.&nbsp; If you are interested in Swing,
	the best place to learn and try it out is at the legion on Commercial Dr. (see <a href="#legion">poster</a> below).

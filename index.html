                <p>Right wing:Your general duties as a wingman are to dig in the corner, feed the centermen and defence, wreak havoc in front of the other teams net, and outsmart the other teams defensemen on both ends of the rink.
                <i><h2>Who is a Goalie</h2></i>
                <p>In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net,  preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the goal crease (often referred to simply as the crease or the net).
                <i><h2>Who is a Right Defense</h2></i>
                <p>In the offensive zone, the defence player acts in his or her usual role, keeping control of the puck as the forwards fight for position. In the first organized ice hockey, (see Amateur Hockey Association of Canada), defencemen used to line up in an "I" formation behind the rover (defunct) as point and coverpoint.</p><br>
           	<i><h2>Who is a Center?</h2></i>
